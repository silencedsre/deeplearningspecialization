Course-1 (Assignment) of Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng.

<h4> These are my assignments for Neural Network and Deep Learning course of Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng in Coursera. Thanks a lot to Andrew Ng and deeplearning.ai for making videos freely available in youtube. And some of the enrolled students in Coursera who made their assignment available in github. I grapsed the concepts and tried to complete the task. I guess, I pretty did a good job. Thanks a lot Andrew Ng. You are an awesome teacher.</h4>
